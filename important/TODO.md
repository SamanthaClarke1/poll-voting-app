# Bugs
------
**deleting polls doesnt seem to edit the database.**
  

### Broken Pages :
------
*No resolutions under 280x360, unless justified because of keyboards, please.*
*Make sure to test for phones **WITH THE KEYBOARD ON**, when there's an input field, or people wont be able to type. I reccomend using the 'nexus 5x' for testing, in the google dev kit.*
| Description                             | Page         | Resolution |.Sevrty|
|:--------------------------------------- |:------------:|:----------:|:-----:|
| Navbar looks too small.                 | layout.ejs   | 400x700    | 03/10 |
| Slight Errors on login page, buttons don't look properly lined up.                                                     | login.ejs    | any        | 05/10 |

### Vulnerability Alarms : 
------
| Vulnerability                 | Page      |.Sevrty| Reccomended Action      |
|:----------------------------- |:---------:|:-----:|:-----------------------:|
| Sam's dev skills are too good, so there are no vulnerabilities.                                               | All of it | 10/10 | Get good boyos          |

### General Buggyness Report
------
*This will be updated by SC. **Only.***

> Very little buggyness has been found on the page. The only bugs I have found would be very hard to notice in a real situation, and only 1/10000 viewers would actually see them. Great job everybody, may you dream of clean code and electric sheep.

> * *Updated: 10/11/17, 1:37 AM*

# Extra Notes :
------
> **SC** :  Maybe we should reconsider the size at which the navbar collapses?

> **SC** :  Perhaps we should center [My Polls](https://poll-voting-app.glitch.me/account) If the screen gets too small? ~400x800 res

> **SC** :  ***Version: Alpha-0.1.2 Released! (Also known as version ðŸ“®ðŸŒ·).*** Congratulations are in order, to celebrate this victory against eur-asia, ***chocolate rations have been raised by ten percent!***
