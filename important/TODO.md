# Bugs

### Broken Pages :
------
*No resolutions under 280x360, unless justified because of keyboards, please.*
*Make sure to test for phones **WITH THE KEYBOARD ON**, when there's an input field, or people wont be able to type. I reccomend using the 'nexus 5x' for testing, in the google dev kit.*
| Description                             | Page         | Resolution |.Sevrty|
|:--------------------------------------- |:------------:|:----------:|:-----:|
| Navbar looks too small.                 | layout.ejs   | 400x700    | 03/10 |
| [Create Button](https://poll-voting-app.glitch.me/account) can't fit text.                                             | account.ejs  | ???x205    | 01/10 |

|:----------------------------- |:---------:|:-----:|:-----------------------:|
| Sam's dev skills are too good, so there are no vulnerabilities.                                               | All of it | 10/10 | Get good boyos          |

### General Buggyness Report
------
*This will be updated by sam. **Only.***

> Very little buggyness has been found on the page. The only bugs I have found would be very hard to notice in a real situation, and only 1/10000 viewers would actually see them. Great job everybody, may you dream of clean code and electric sheep.

# Extra Notes :
------
> C: Maybe we should reconsider the size at which the navbar collapses?

> C: Perhaps we should center [My Polls](https://poll-voting-app.glitch.me/account) If the screen gets too small? ~400x800 res
